This is one of my favorite challenges during my Full stack developer course.

It is a simple dice game where your get random dice images every time you refresh the page.

Very simple, the player with the highest dice roll gets a winner message, if the images end up being the same you get a dar message.

One of my favorite parts of working on this prject is how much thinking I gave it before even starting to code, my very first idea was using arrays but was a little worried I was not going to be able to do it using arrays.

To my surprise a little bit of google was enough to find a way to implement an array of images after that it all became so imple that I felt a bit dumb for overthinking it.

Added the solution given by the instructor as a comment so you can also be amazed by just one of the probably many different ways to do this exercise! I love programming!.
